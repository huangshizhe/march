  Sample XML configuration file for the following ESP model:
  Orders[src + csv read connector]  ====> TotalVolume[aggr]

  so we:
  1. automatically start populating the Orders window
  from the orders.csv file using a built-in file/socket
  connector.

  2. aggregate the orders by security, and compute the total
  volume traded for the aggregate security.

  to test this model one can:

  subscribe to the final TotalVolume window to see the
  computed data when we start the trades data flowing:
  $DFESP_HOME/bin/subscribe_client dfESP://localhost:55555/orders_proj/orders_cq/TotalVolume?snapshot=true

  NOTE: The subscription must be started after the model starts.
  Also as soon as the model starts the built in file/socket
  connector begins processing data from orders.csv.
